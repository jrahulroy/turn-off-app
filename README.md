Turn Off - Windows 8 Metro Style App

This app was created as an entry project for Imagine Cup 2012.

It is a simple game where it consists of a grid of lights. On click of a light, it changes it state from off to on or on to off along with four surrounding lights. The Goal is to turn all the lights off, by making series of clicks.

This is create in Microsoft Visual Studio 2011. We have Javascript, CSS for the creation of the App.

We have made use of Share Contracts, Charms Bar API and layout features available in Windows 8.
